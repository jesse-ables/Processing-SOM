# Processing-SOM
A visual SOM programmed in processing. This was just a simple project to get back into programming in Processing while also understanding SOMs for research purposes. http://jjguy.com/som/ was used for the initial concept, but I don't believe I used any code from anywhere. The goal was to make as much of this from scratch as possible. I believe the above website also links to another SOM website that had some useful insights. 

Project is done, but I may add in scalability testing for fun. I havent drawn graphs in Processing yet, so that seems like a fun project.

Runtime? Glad you asked. This is the ***fastest*** som out there at O(N^2). ***slaps som***    This bad boy can fit *sooooo* many N's inside of its O(). /s

# Dependencies
Processing 4

# How to Run
Tapping '1' will cause the SOM to run
Pressing 'r' will reset the SOM and training colors

If you want the SOM to be bigger or use more training colors, the variables are the top of the 'som.pde' file. The visuals for the training colors only work up to about 30 colors. You can do more, but you won't be able to view more than 30 prior to running.
